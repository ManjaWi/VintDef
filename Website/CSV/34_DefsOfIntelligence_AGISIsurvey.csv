AGISI0005,MI definition,"“The essence of intelligence is the principle of adapting to the environment while working with insufficient knowledge and resources.

AGISI0006,MI definition,"“The goal is to build computer systems that exhibit the full range of the cognitive capabilities we find in humans. […] The ability to pursue tasks across a broad range of domains, in complex physical and social environments. [A human-level intelligence] system needs broad competence. It needs to successfully work on a wide variety of problems, using different types of knowledge and learning in different situations, but it does not need to generate optimal behavior.”","Laird, J.

AGISI0018,HI definition,"“Intelligence means organization of ideas, manifold interconnection of all those ideas which ought to enter into a unitary group because of the natural relations of the objective facts represented by them. The discovery of a physical law in a multitude of phenomena apparently unrelated, the interpretation of an historical event of which only a few details are directly known, are examples of intelligence thought which takes into consideration innumerable experiences neglected by the less intelligent mind. Neither memory alone nor attention alone is the foundation of intelligence, but a union of memory and attention.”","Ebbinghaus, H.","Psychology: An Elementary Text-book. M. F. Meyer (Ed.). Boston: Heath, 1908.",1908

AGISI0024,HI definition,"“Intelligence, as the sum total of all cognitive processes, entails planning, coding of information and attention arousal. Of these, the cognitive processes required for planning have a relatively higher status in intelligence. Planning is a broad term which includes among other things, the generation of plans and strategies, selection from among available plans, and the execution of those plans. […] Coding refers to two modes of processing information, simultaneous and successive. […] The remaining process (attention arousal) is a function basic to all other higher cognitive activities.”","Das, J. P.","On definition of intelligence. In R. J. Sternberg and D. K.

AGISI0025,HI definition,"“Intelligence is mental self-government. […] The essence of intelligence is that it provides a means to govern ourselves so that our thoughts and actions are organized, coherent, and responsive to both our internally driven needs and to the needs of the environment.”","Sternberg, R. J.","Intelligence is mental self-government. In R. J. Sternberg and D. K. Detterman (eds.), What is intelligence? Contemporary viewpoints on its nature and definition (pp. 141-148).

AGISI0027,HI definition,"“Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings — 'catching on,' 'making sense' of things, or 'figuring out' what to do.”","Gottfredson, L.

AGISI0029,HI definition,"“My view of intelligence is basically a Darwinian one. It's based on sort of the old Functionalist notion that goes way back to Francis Galton, that says that there are a certain set of cognitive capacities that enable an individual to adapt and thrive in any given environment they find themselves in, and those cognitive capacities include things like memory and retrieval, and problem solving and so forth. There's a cluster of cognitive abilities that lead to successful adaptation to a wide range of environments.”","Simonton, D. K.","Definition of Intelligence. Human Intelligence.

AGISI0030,HI definition,"“Intelligence is: 1) the ability to achieve one’s goals in life, given one’s sociocultural context; 2) by capitalizing on strengths and correcting or compensating for weaknesses; 3) in order to adapt to, shape, and select environments; and, 4) through a combination of analytical, creative, and practical abilities.”","Sternberg, R. J.","The Theory of Successful Intelligence. Journal of Psychology, 39(2):189–202, 2005.",2005

AGISI0033,HI definition,To think and behave “rationally means taking the appropriate action given one's goals and beliefs and holding beliefs that are commensurate with available evidence.” Intelligence is thus: “optimal behavior in the domain of practical affairs.
