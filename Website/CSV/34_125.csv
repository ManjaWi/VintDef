AGISI-HI-347,HI definition,"Human intelligence is not one thing. It is a complex set of embodied intelligences which include at least the ability to act and react (sometimes instinctively) in the physical world; (crucially) social intelligence - the ability to form beliefs about others intentions (theory of mind) as well as learn socially from others, by imitation for instance to to experience empathy; individual intelligence - the ability to learn by trial and error (i.e. developmental learning) - and to generalise learned behaviour from one context to another, to synthesise new ideas from previously disconnected ones (to innovate and be creative); the ability to construct scaffolds of metaphors or abstractions - grounded in embodiment, which are crucial to language and mathematics etc - we could call this storytelling intelligence (storytelling is a profoundly important property of humans - arguably the root of culture); and the ability to think reflexively - i.e. to think about thinking (self-consciousness); and probably other forms of intelligence.

So general intelligence is the ability to perceive and model relevant patterns and then act upon these, within a broad range of environments. Human intelligence is 'general' in this sense, compared to many other species, though we may or may not be able to perceive and act on all goals that other (otherwise less 'generally intelligent) creatures are able to act on.","Dinov, M.","AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
