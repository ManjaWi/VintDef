AGISI-HI-005,HI definition,"Intelligence (whether we're speaking of a human or a machine) is the ability to put one's finger on the essence of situations that one faces, and to do so reasonably rapidly. Intelligence is the art of rapid and reliable gist-finding, crux-spotting, bull's-eye hitting, nub-striking, essence-pinpointing. It is the art of, when one is facing a new situation, swiftly and surely homing in on an insightful precedent (or family of precedents) stored in the recesses of one's memory. That, no more and no less, is what it means to isolate the crux of a new situation. And this is nothing but the ability to find close analogues, which is to say, the ability to come up with strong and useful analogies.","Hofstadter, D.","AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-HI-226,HI definition,"Intelligence is the repertoire of skills, knowledge, learning sets, and generalization tendencies of an individual which allow them to see relationships and use this to solve problems.","Azencott, C.-A.","AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-HI-276,HI definition,"We should take into account an evolutionary dimension. The brain evolved to extend the lifespan and the probability of reproduction.
