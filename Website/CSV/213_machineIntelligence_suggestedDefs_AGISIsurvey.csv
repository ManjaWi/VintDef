AGISI-MI-189,MI definition,"The essential task of an intelligent system is to keep itself within a given region of its state space in the face varying dynamics in the external world.

AGISI-MI-247,MI definition,"Intelligence is the unconstrained ability to learn and adapt to new situations (even if the adaptation is not optimal). It seems to me that intelligence also requires a degree of self-identity - the ability of model oneself in one's idea of world. Intelligence is not an ""on-off"" switch - like all other biological systems that we know of, it was evolved over time, and is found in different degrees in different beings. Accordingly, machine intelligence should be seen as to what degree a construct is able to react, learn and adapt to its environments, and to what degree a construct is able to self-identify. We are not yet close to make a machine as intelligent as a hamster, trying to tie intelligence to human displays of intelligence is premature.",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
