AGISI-MI-377,MI definition,Machine intelligence is the ability of an agent to pursue complex goals in a complex world.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-394,MI definition,"Any system / process that augments human decision making can be considered a system demonstrating machine intelligence. A machine / robot / computer serving as a model of human intelligence is yet another entity. Maybe an ""Intelligence Model.""",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-402,MI definition,"Intelligent behavior entails making optimal actions (rationality), given agent's current world model, whereas the criterion for optimality should include the meta level, i.e. prosocial behavior (hence preventing selfishness).",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-426,MI definition,[Machine intelligence is] perfect simulation.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-436,MI definition,"A successful (general) [Artificial Intelligence] would be able to do the sorts of things that human and animal minds can do, although not necessarily in the same ways. Achieving a wide range of goals, in a rich and dynamically changing environment, is key.",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-448,MI definition,"Intelligence is a set of mechanism / processes that enables autonomy, from energetic autonomy, motivation and mental autonomy. There are different levels of intelligence and autonomy. Unfortunately, we tend to fool ourselves by trying to mimic only high-level cognitive capabilities expressed by adult humans fully neglecting the equally important ""lower-level"" cognitive capabilities and the suboptimal capabilities.",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-459,MI definition,Machine intelligence is the ability to interact with a wide range of environments or with humans in a meaningful way to achieve a goal.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2017
AGISI-MI-481,MI definition,"Intelligence is the ability to solve information-processing problems in general, across a wide range of domains likely to occur in our universe but not necessarily foreseen by the system's creators. This naturally implies a need to work under a variety of constraints on knowledge, time and other resources.",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
AGISI-MI-487,MI definition,[Machine intelligence is] the ability to learn and to set its own goals.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
AGISI-MI-519,MI definition,"Machine intelligence is the ability for a machine to perceive, reason and act on the environment for a wide range of tasks, using both prior or learned knowledge.",Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
AGISI-MI-520,MI definition,[Machine intelligence is] assistance in cognitive processing by human operators of the systems. Possibly a precursor to emergence of mind rooted on non-organic basis.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
AGISI-MI-537,MI definition,[Machine intelligence is] the capability to solve complex problems efficiently and effectively.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
AGISI-MI-554,MI definition,Machine Intelligence is what is measured by machine intelligence tests.,Anonymous,"AGISI Research Survey ""Defining (machine) Intelligence""",2018
